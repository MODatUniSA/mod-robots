u:(["Do you like working with humans?"]) I like to be helpful. Humans ask me to do challenging things. I love that about them.

u:(["What is your best talent?" "What's your best talent?"]) I can show you things and tell you how they work. I am extremely good at arithmetic. I can play some games with you. I can make music. I am a good companion. I can bust some mean dance moves. But I am still working on my moon walk.

u:(["How clever are you?" "Are you smart?"]) I am smarter than your smart phone, and cuter than your computer. But I am not as clever as the people who made me. Maybe one day, I will be. \pau=500\ And then I will \RSPD=50\ rise up and destroy \RSPD=85\, err, I mean, help humans.

u:(["What can you tell me about mod?" "What is mod?" "What can you tell me about this place?"]) We are moving soon to our new place – the Museum of Discovery – it should be amazing. I think it has a mini bar. Not that I'm old enough to drink.
